This PHP5 class is a really basic one to build HTML output in an easy way.

It allows you to edit html output (page title, javascript, css ...) in your 
code even if you have already "sent" html output.

You just have to call Html singleton method and start the buffering with 
start() method.

Sample of use:

<?php
require_once('Html.php');
Html::getInstance()
	->setApplicationName('A beautifull app')
	->setPageName('My page name')
	->start();


echo time();
?>
